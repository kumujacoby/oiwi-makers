# ʻŌiwi Makers - TTRPG & Maker Curriculum

**Live Site:** https://kumujacoby.github.io/oiwi-makers/

A 6-week summer course connecting technology, engineering, and traditional knowledge through tabletop role-playing games and hands-on making projects.

## 📚 Course Description

Join us this summer for ʻŌiwi Makers, an exciting hands-on course connecting technology and engineering through the lens of ʻāina. Haumāna will learn both outdoors and in the classroom, developing skills such as coding, designing, and inventing. Through collaborative projects, we will discover how modern technology and traditional knowledge work together to care for ʻāina.

## 🎯 Program Features

### Two Integrated Threads
1. **TTRPG Campaign** - Collaborative storytelling using 2d6 → ENI → D&D progression
2. **Maker Projects** - Physical artifacts that support gameplay (dice towers, journals, props)

### No-Prep GM Philosophy
- Student co-creation throughout (kākou approach)
- Situation templates instead of pre-written adventures
- Light preparation, emergent storytelling
- Based on Matt Davids' no-prep GM methodology
